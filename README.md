# Crop_identification
The  model has been built to predict rice crops against non-rice crops using features from the Sentinel-1 (RTC) dataset as predictor variables. In this demonstration, we have used two features from the Sentinel-1 dataset, namely VV (Vertical polarization – Vertical polarization) and VH (Vertical polarization – Horizontal polarization)
